Help us kick off our inaugural casual game night in style.

On Tuesday, August 21st, we'll start holding monthly game nights at Kiln, near Thanksgiving Point, from 7-9 pm. Our friends from the Saltworks will be bringing Rumble Plugs, an awesome game developed locally here in Utah! We'll also have Mario Kart set up, and feel free to bring your laptop to play League of Legends or anything else. We'll have soda, party games, and fun people to hang out with.

Oh yeah, and it's free.
