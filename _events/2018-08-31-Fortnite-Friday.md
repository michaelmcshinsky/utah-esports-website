Join us at Microsoft Store for weekly tournaments at ROG Arena’s Fortnite Fridays. Play like the pros in a fun, elimination-style format and win prizes including V-Bucks or Microsoft gift cards.

Welcome to ROG Arena: Fortnite Fridays at Microsoft Store! We are excited to be hosting weekly Fortnite events and opportunities to compete in-store for V-Bucks. Show up to your local store on Fridays from 5:30 - 9:00 PM to participate. Sign up is free and all hardware is provided - all you need to do is pre-register on your local store's page, and show up at the door to compete!*

*Pre-registering through Smashgg does not guarantee you a spot in the tournament. Tournament entry is first-come, first-serve until all spots are filled.
