The hosting Player will host a DUOS game session and invite his/her opponent. Both players will ready up and begin play. 

HOW TO WIN: The combined amount of kills for each game will determine the winning Player. If out of the two games played the kills are tied, a third map will be played to determine the winner for the match.

-Causing opponents to miss shots or miss opportunities for advancing their scores in any way shape or form.
-Building in front of your opponent.
