Wow! Savage! Calculated.

You might be able to air dribble past your opponents, but can you dribble on the ground and flick at the perfect time? Sure, you can pinch it of the wall any time you want, but can you defend against a nasty ceiling shot? Get ready to spam "What A Save!" as you prove your worth at Weber State's 1v1 Rocket League Tournament!

Come join CLAW Gaming on Tuesday, September 4th for an epic 1v1 tournament, as well as a King of the Hill style battle that will ultimately decide who's got what it takes to be the best at Weber! Tryouts for our varsity and JV teams will be held after the tournament, so be sure to stay afterwards!

IMPORTANT: You MUST bring your own controller and cord. Only the computers will be provided. Please do not forget, or else you might have to play like Genocop...
