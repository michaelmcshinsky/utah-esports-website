Two of our favorite things are LAN parties, and vacations, and we've had a vision for a long time of combining the two.

We were finally able to test it out, and weren't surprised to find that everyone loved it. Not only does it create an entirely new experience by being able to do what you love in an upscale, fresh new resort environment with like-minded people, but you're also able to game away from home and away from any day-to-day distractions. Game, take a break and play ping pong, game some more, let us bring you awesome food, eat, game some more, head to the pool for a while, then stay up as late as you want gaming. And do all this for about the price you might find yourself paying for a decent hotel and fast food. 

The attendees at our first event couldn't stop telling us how much of a blast they had, and repeatedly asked us when we were doing it again.

## Where

A 6,000 square foot, 9-bedroom vacation home in Santa Clara, Utah, about 15 minutes from St. George, Utah, and less than 2 hours from Las Vegas. The house is equipped with a home theater (120" 4k), ping pong table, private hot tub, private deck, patio, shared two-tier pool with adult-only hours, shared pickle-ball/tennis courts, and shared workout facility.

## What

This event will be the optimal mix of vacationing, relaxation, and video games. Most of what we'll be doing is playing PC games. However, if you need a screen break, or need to stretch your legs, head over to the community pool (with adult only hours), the private hot tub, play some ping pong or a board game, or enjoy a variety of other activities. We'll also have a Nintendo Switch with some good co-op/party games set up in the home theater. This event will focus on Blizzard games, League of Legends, Fortnite/PUBG, but you can play whatever you want. See the 'Bring' section for more information.

## When

The 3-night event will begin the evening of Thursday, September 6th - and end the morning of Sunday, September 9th. Arrive as early as 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, and we'll need to be out of the house by 10:30 a.m. on Sunday.
