Swing by our set-up to check out what we have to offer this year with our Intramurals, competitive team tryouts starting on Sep 20th, and some free swag! Depending on the location (TBD) we'll be able to set up some Smash Bros for people to play and just hang out. Bring your new friends by to learn more about our events.

We'll be there both Tuesday the 18th and Wednesday the 19th!
