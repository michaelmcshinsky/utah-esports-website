Come join us for an overnight LAN event at No Pause!!

Jared and I have been looking into getting an opening LAN for some time, and Hayden at No Pause reached out to us!

They are very generous in letting us use their facility, so let's not let it go to waste!

There will be around 40 open spots to bring your own computer, TV, laptop, etc. There will also be around 30 gaming computers available to use there!

Things to Bring:
Computer/Device
Power Strip (if you have one, that would be lovely)
Ethernet Cable

Games Like:
Super Smash
Overwatch
Heroes of the Storm
Hearthstone
League of Legends
Fortnite
and many more!
