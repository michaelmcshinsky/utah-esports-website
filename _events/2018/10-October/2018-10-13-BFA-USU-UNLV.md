For the ameteur bracket, all others in the pools, who have not won a previous Smash Jam Ameteur bracket within the past six months and are not within the top 30 of the most recent PR, will have the choice to sign up for the bracket. We will call out for certain pools to sign up for the bracket, up until 15 minutes prior to the split time. Prizes are as follows:
