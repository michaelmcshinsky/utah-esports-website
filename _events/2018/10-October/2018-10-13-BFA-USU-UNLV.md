Our next big themed event will be Battle for Azeroth. We will be playing multiple different games as we split you all up into teams. You will either be marked down as horde or alliance in our first big clash at the university. 

The games will be as follows:

6v6 Volleyball

5v5 Dodgeball

3v3 Rocket League (bo5)

5v5 HOTS (bo3)

2 v 2 Jenga (3 teams each 6 teams total)

5v5 Smash 4 Crews

There will be time for you all to convene as a team and designate who plays in what event and 1 person cannot play in 2 events. You're more than welcome to spectate and cheer your teams on!
