Get ready for the first ever UVU Esports VR event. Thanks to our sponsors at No Pause Gaming and Virtual Experience, as well as a few of our members, we are putting on the spookiest VR event in Utah. We'll be running some tournaments for a few different games on VR stations set-up at the event, as well as running a couple different challenges across the entire event. There will be pizza and prizes of course! Look forward to seeing you all there!
