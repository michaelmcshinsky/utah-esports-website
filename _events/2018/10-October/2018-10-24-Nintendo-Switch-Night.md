The Utah iOS & Mac Group proudly presents..

Swith Night

If you got a Nintendo Switch, bring it! Controllers and a dock are helpful too. USB ethernet is not required but highly recommended.

If you don't have a Nintendo Switch, come anyway!

Bring a friend or your kids!


Location:

ExpertVoice is located in the Boston Building (next to DevMountain) on Main Street between 400 S. and Broadway.

Parking on the street is free after 8pm and there is a Trax station nearby.

The building locks at 6pm, so call / text Josh Lytle @ 801-888-3588 or comment in #switch-night, if you can't get in.
