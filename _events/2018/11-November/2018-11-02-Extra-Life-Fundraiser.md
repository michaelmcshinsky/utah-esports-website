We are hosting a collaborative event involving local teams, streamers, businesses, and gamers in Salt Lake City and the surrounding area as we raise money for Primary Children's Hospital in Downtown SLC.

Your donation is tax-deductible and will make miracles happen for families who desperately need them.

Thank you so much for supporting our efforts!
