This is a charity event for Primary Children's Hospital. It will be a 24-hour event with esports tournaments, table top tournaments, virtual reality, a silent auction, a blood drive, prizes and food. Proceeds of the event go to our Extra Life donation. There won't be an entry fee but a $20 donation to Extra Life is strongly encouraged.

The highlight of the event will be when we have some kids from Primary Children's Hospital bused down to come play and compete with us on Saturday. It is going to be an awesome event! Come check it out and let's help these kids in need!

Thank you so much for supporting our efforts!
