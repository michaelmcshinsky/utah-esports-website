We will be having our League of Legends World's finals viewing party in the Centre Stage. We will be working with the staff on campus to be able to accommodate as many people as possible, so feel free to invite any of your friends! 

Campus police do not want any minors at the event, we'll be holding another event this month because of this, sorry if you're a minor, but it'll be very unlikely that you may attend. 

It'll be a fun event with lots of people and an awesome stadium view for the finals! We're working on some events we can do before the final game starts, we'll post more once we have the plan finalized. See you all there!
