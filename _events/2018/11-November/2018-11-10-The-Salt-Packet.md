Event Description
The Salt Packet is bringing to the table what many of our Utahn players love-- Money Matches. That's right, Super Smash Bros. for WiiU players will have hours upon hours of amazing money matches.

Think you can bring the best Cloud Utah has ever seen? Well here's your chance to prove it. And maybe make a little money too.
