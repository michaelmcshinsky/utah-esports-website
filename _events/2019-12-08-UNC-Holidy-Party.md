We've received word that the grand opening for the South Town Round 1 arcade will be on Saturday the 11th of August! Come join us as we welcome Round 1 Arcade to Utah!

Round 1 Arcade is a nationwide chain of arcades which feature the best games, including the newest and hottest games from Japan. They also have indoor bowling, a massive redemption space, karaoke rooms, and more! 

Meetup time is 7 or 8pm, and most of us will be staying and gaming until closing!

More information will be made available as the date approaches.
