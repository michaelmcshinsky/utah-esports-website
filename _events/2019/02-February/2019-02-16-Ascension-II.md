Our second Ultimate monthly! Coming off of an astounding 150 entrants in January, we're looking to double down with a tighter schedule and even more entrants! 

Continuing in the tradition of our monthly events, this event will feature a doubles bracket as well as bracket pools for singles, with an amateur bracket for all those who don't make it to Top 64! 

Pre-registration for this event will be mandatory, however pre-payment is not. While the option to pay in advance via SmashGG will be available, you will also be able to select "Pay On Site" and pay at the venue on the day of the event! All in-person payments must be received by 11 am on the day of the event. Those who have not paid by the designated time will be disqualified from the tournament. 

Registration will close on Thursday, February 14th at midnight. This will give us a full day to seed brackets and assign volunteers, as well as optimize the schedule. If you're on the fence about attending, we recommend registering. If you decide not to attend, just let us know and we'll remove you from the event! 

With the growth of these events comes the need for volunteers to help us with pool captaining! If you're interested in helping your community out as well as saving a few dollars, head over to tinyurl.com/SAKUltimateVolunteer and register to volunteer for the event! Captaining one pool will get you $5 off your venue fee, and captaining two pools will waive your venue fee entirely!
