In January you made your New Year's Resolutions. Now it's time to make some REVOLUTIONS.

We are excited to be hosting our first big event of spring semester where we're ready to make some Gaming Revolutions for the year. Anyone can make a resolution but we're going to help make some revolutions in how we play games. Join us for new and exciting tournaments in League, Overwatch and Smash Ultimate where we will be changing the way the games are played! 

Whether you play in the tournaments or just come for the fun, friends and games; we will have raffle and door prizes available for everyone! Watch our announcements all week for tournament specifics!

5:00 p.m. - Doors Open, Door prizes available for first entrants
6:00 p.m. - League tournament begins
7:00 p.m. - Smash tournament begins

*Hearthstone fireside will also be running throughout the event*
